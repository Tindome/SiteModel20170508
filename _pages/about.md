Oh hey --- I'm Michael Rose, just another boring, tattooed, time traveling designer from Buffalo, New York. I'm into drawing [portraits of strangers]({{ site.url }}/paperfaces/) on an iPad, eating popcorn and [chicken wings](http://www.duffswings.com "Duff's Famous Wings"), watching dust collect on my [vinyl record collection](http://www.discogs.com/user/mmistakes/collection), and playing the occasional iOS game.
